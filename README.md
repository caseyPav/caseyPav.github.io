TO DO:

1. FIX TOUCH LINKS!!!
2. finish child pages
3. refactor to clean up
4. make world adaptable to changed resolutions after load, currently canvas locks to initial resolution,
   this causes the mutable objects to end up just below the viewable screen area on some mobile
   browsers, requiring scrolling
5. more stuff
